                    known for its explosive, high-impact attacks and playful combat style. Cannoneers wield a hand
                    cannon, which grants them long-range capabilities, and they partner with a companion monkey who
                    supports in battle. This class excels at dealing damage across wide areas, making them particularly
                    strong for mobbing and handling large groups of enemies.</h5>
                <p class="card-text">A distinctive aspect of the Cannoneer is its synergy with a loyal monkey companion,
                    who aids in combat and offers supportive buffs. The Monkey Magic buff boosts essential stats,
                    including HP, MP, and attack power, enhancing both the Cannoneer and any nearby party members, which
                    makes the Cannoneer highly valued in group settings. For added survivability, Cannoneers also have
                    Barrel Roulette, which can randomly grant helpful effects like increased attack speed or additional
                    damage reduction.</p>
                <p>With its combination of powerful AoE skills, self-sustaining abilities, and supportive party buffs,
                    the Cannoneer is an all-around powerhouse that’s fun and accessible for beginners yet capable of
                    high-level performance in both solo and team play. The Cannoneer’s gameplay is energetic and
                    explosive, perfect for players who enjoy big, satisfying hits and a well-rounded combat experience.
